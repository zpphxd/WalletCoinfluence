# TIER 3: TO BE RESEARCHED
# ============================================

# 6-10: Need to manually find from:
# - GMGN.ai discover page (https://gmgn.ai/discover?chain=sol)
# - Nansen Solana Smart Money dashboard (requires account)
# - Twitter/X crypto traders sharing their watchlists
# - Solscan top holders of successful memecoins (BONK, WIF, POPCAT)

# NEXT STEPS:
# 1. Manually visit GMGN.ai and copy top 5 wallets from Smart Money section
# 2. Check Solscan for top holders of BONK, WIF, POPCAT (filter out exchanges)
# 3. Search Twitter for "Solana smart money" + wallet addresses
# 4. Add wallet addresses to custom_watchlist_wallets table
# 5. Fix Helius/Solscan APIs to track them

# NOTES:
# - .sol addresses need to be resolved to base58 addresses for API calls
# - All addresses should be verified as non-exchange wallets
# - Focus on wallets with 60%+ win rate and $100k+ realized PnL
