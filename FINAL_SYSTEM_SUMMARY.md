# Alpha Wallet Scout - Complete System Summary

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS LEARNING MODE
**Telegram Alerts**: üîï PAUSED (learning phase)

## üéØ WHAT WE BUILT

### The Vision
**An AI system that learns to trade crypto by following profitable whale wallets.**

When 2+ proven whales buy the same token within 30 minutes ‚Üí High-confidence buy signal.

### The Innovation (What Makes This Different)

**Traditional Approach** ‚ùå:
- Track all wallets (95% noise)
- Alert on single buys (false positives)
- Use stale price data (can't track real PnL)
- No learning mechanism

**Our Approach** ‚úÖ:
- Track ONLY profitable whales (TOP 30)
- Alert ONLY on confluence (‚â•2 whales agree)
- Use LIVE price data (real-time PnL)
- **SELF-LEARNING** with paper trading + rewards/punishments

---

## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 4-Stage Discovery Pipeline

#### 1. FIND TRENDING TOKENS (Every 5 min)
```
GeckoTerminal API ‚Üí Top 50 trending tokens per chain
Output: ~60 tokens with high volume/liquidity
```

#### 2. DISCOVER WHALES (Every 5-10 min)
```
Standard Discovery (10 min):
  Alchemy API ‚Üí All buyers of trending tokens (16h lookback)
  Output: All wallet addresses buying trending tokens

Enhanced Discovery (5 min):
  Alchemy API ‚Üí ONLY $10k+ trades (real whales)
  Output: Big money wallets making large trades
```

#### 3. CALCULATE REAL PNL (Every 15 min)
```
Multi-Source Price Fetcher:
  Try DexScreener ‚Üí current price
  Try Birdeye ‚Üí current price
  Try CoinGecko ‚Üí current price
  Fallback: last trade price

FIFO PnL Calculator:
  For each whale:
    For each token:
      current_value = qty √ó LIVE_PRICE
      unrealized_pnl = current_value - cost_basis

Composite Scoring:
  score = 0.30 √ó Unrealized PnL
        + 0.30 √ó Trade Activity
        + 0.40 √ó EarlyScore (timing)

Output: TOP 30 whales by composite score
```

#### 4. MONITOR & ALERT (Every 2 min)
```
For each TOP 30 whale:
  Check for new trades (Alchemy API, 100 tx lookback)
  Record in Redis (30-min window)

  If ‚â•2 whales bought same token:
    ‚Üí CONFLUENCE DETECTED
    ‚Üí (Alert paused during learning)
    ‚Üí Paper trader BUYS automatically

  If ‚â•2 whales sold same token:
    ‚Üí WHALE EXIT SIGNAL
    ‚Üí Paper trader SELLS automatically
```

## ü§ñ THE LEARNING SYSTEM

### Self-Rewarding Performance Tracker

**SCALED REWARDS** (Bigger success = Bigger reward):

**üéÅ Whale Discovery Rewards**:
- +10 pts: Small fish ($100-$1k PnL)
- +50 pts: Decent whale ($1k-$10k PnL)
- +200 pts: BIG whale ($10k-$50k PnL)
- +500 pts: HUGE whale ($50k-$100k PnL)
- +1000 pts: LEGENDARY whale ($100k+ PnL)

**üéÅ Confluence Detection Rewards**:
```
reward = 100 √ó num_whales √ó speed_multiplier

Speed Multipliers:
- 2.0x if detected <5min (INSTANT)
- 1.5x if detected <15min (FAST)
- 1.0x if detected <30min (OK)

Example: 3 whales buying, detected in 4min = +600 pts
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è PUNISHMENTS** (Learn from mistakes):

**Late Detection Penalties** (Exponential):
- -10 pts: 5-15min late
- -50 pts: 15-30min late
- -200 pts: 30-60min late
- -500 pts: >60min late (completely missed)

**Bad Whale Penalties** (Scaled by losses):
- -5 pts: Minor loser ($100-$1k loss)
- -25 pts: Bad whale ($1k-$10k loss)
- -100 pts: TERRIBLE whale ($10k-$50k loss)
- -250 pts: DISASTER whale (>$50k loss)

### Paper Trading System ($1,000 Starting Balance)

**Autonomous Trading Logic**:

**BUY Rules**:
- When ‚â•2 TOP whales buy same token
- Invest 20% of current balance per trade
- Only follow whales with >$1k unrealized PnL
- Record entry price, timestamp, number of whales

**SELL Rules** (Auto-execute when ANY condition met):
1. **Take Profit**: +20% gain
2. **Stop Loss**: -10% loss
3. **Max Hold**: 24 hours
4. **Whale Exit**: ‚â•2 whales selling same token

**LEARNING from Results**:
- Win rate >70%? ‚Üí Increase position size to 30%, lower take profit to 15%
- Win rate <40%? ‚Üí Decrease position size to 10%, raise take profit to 30%
- Continuously adjusts every 10 trades

**Performance Tracking**:
```
Every trade:
  If profitable ‚Üí Reward based on % gain
  If loss ‚Üí Punishment based on % loss

Every hour:
  Generate performance report
  Save state to JSON file
  Adjust trading rules if needed
```

  - Skip buys if recent losses

SMART SELL DECISIONS:
  - Take profit at optimal %
  - Cut losses quickly
  - Respect whale exit signals

PERFORMANCE REPORT (hourly):
  Portfolio: $1,000 ‚Üí $1,150 (+15% ROI)

  Worst Trade: -10% stop loss (whale quality issue)

  Learning: Higher whale count = higher win rate
  Adjustment: Require 3+ whales for future buys
```

## üéì WHAT THE SYSTEM LEARNS

### Pattern Recognition
- **Which whales are most profitable?** ‚Üí Follow them more
- **What confluence size wins most?** ‚Üí Require that many whales
- **What hold time is optimal?** ‚Üí Adjust max_hold_hours
- **Which chains perform best?** ‚Üí Prioritize those chains

### Self-Improvement
- **High wins** ‚Üí Take more risk (larger positions, faster exits)
- **High losses** ‚Üí Take less risk (smaller positions, wider stops)
- **Fast signals** ‚Üí Reward detection speed
- **Slow signals** ‚Üí Punish delays, optimize monitoring

### Whale Quality Filter
- Track each whale's contribution to wins/losses
- Increase min_whale_pnl if low-PnL whales lose money
- Decrease if high-PnL requirement misses opportunities
- Continuously refine TOP 30 selection criteria

---

## üöÄ AFTER 24 HOURS

### Performance Review
```bash
# Check paper trading results
docker exec wallet_scout_worker python3 -c "
from src.scheduler.autonomous_trader import AutonomousPaperTrader
trader = AutonomousPaperTrader()
print(trader.get_performance_report())
"
```

### Decision Points

**IF ROI > 10% AND Win Rate > 60%**:
- ‚úÖ System is working!
- ‚úÖ Whale pool is solid
- ‚úÖ Ready to re-enable Telegram alerts
- ‚úÖ User can follow the same trades

**IF ROI < 0% OR Win Rate < 40%**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need more learning time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust whale quality filters
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tune confluence requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep alerts paused, run 24 more hours

### Re-Enabling Alerts (When Ready)
```bash
# Edit .env - uncomment:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8482390902:AAHFiGq9q9Gt-P7ErpZL0FDs9PyEYIwmN_c
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=8416972017

# Restart
docker compose restart worker
```

**Then you'll get the SAME signals the paper trader is profiting from!**

---

## üí° THE KEY INSIGHT

**This isn't just a whale tracker.**

**It's an AI that:**
1. ‚úÖ Discovers profitable traders
2. ‚úÖ Learns which ones to follow
3. ‚úÖ Trades automatically based on their signals
4. ‚úÖ Rewards itself for good picks
5. ‚úÖ Punishes itself for bad picks
6. ‚úÖ Adjusts strategy based on results
7. ‚úÖ Gets better over time

**And YOU get the same signals it's profiting from!**

---

## üìä MONITORING DURING LEARNING

### Check Paper Trading Performance
```bash
docker exec wallet_scout_worker python3 -c "
from src.analytics.paper_trading import PaperTradingTracker
from src.db.session import SessionLocal

db = SessionLocal()
trader = PaperTradingTracker(db, 1000)
# Load from saved file
import json
with open('paper_trading_log.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    trader.current_balance = data['current_balance']
    trader.closed_trades = data['closed_trades']

print(trader.get_performance_report())
"
```

### Check Self-Scoring
```bash
docker logs wallet_scout_worker --tail 100 | grep "REWARD\|PUNISHMENT\|Score:"
```

### Check Whale Pool Growth
```bash
docker exec wallet_scout_db psql -U wallet_scout -d wallet_scout -c "
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_whales,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN unrealized_pnl_usd > 0 THEN 1 END) as profitable,
    ROUND(AVG(unrealized_pnl_usd)::numeric, 2) as avg_pnl
FROM wallet_stats_30d;
"
```

- üí∞ Calculating their real PnL
- ü§ñ Trading autonomously based on confluence
- üèÜ Learning what works and what doesn't
- üìà Getting better with every trade

**In 24 hours, we'll know:**
- ‚úÖ Which whales are reliably profitable
- ‚úÖ What confluence patterns lead to wins
- ‚úÖ Optimal trading rules (position size, take profit, etc.)
- ‚úÖ If the system can actually make money

**Then you can follow the SAME trades it's making!**

**Patience now = Proven signals later.** ü§ñüí∞‚ú®
