## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve

1. **No Closed Trades Yet** - Need to hit +5% or -10% to measure win rate
2. **Capital Deployed** - $610 tied up, may need more liquidity
3. **Solana Whale Monitoring** - Need to test Helius API for Tier 1 whales
4. **Stablecoin Filtering** - Detecting confluence on USDC/WETH (should skip)
5. **Whale Tier Weighting** - Tier 1 ($10M+) should count 3x more than Tier 3

---

## üìà Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Wait for First Sell** - One position should hit +5% or -10% soon
2. **Monitor Base Network** - Highest activity, most opportunities
3. **Track Custom Whales** - Our 3 top performers for confluence

### Short-Term (Next 7 Days)
1. **Test Solana Whale Monitoring** - Verify Helius tracks our 5 new whales
2. **Implement Whale Tier Weighting** - Tier 1 = 3x, Tier 2 = 2x, Tier 3 = 1x
3. **Refine Filters** - Skip WETH, USDC, USDT from trading
4. **Build Win Rate** - Need 10+ closed trades for statistics
5. **Add "Mega Whale Solo Buy" Alerts** - Alert if ANY Tier 1 whale buys (no confluence needed)

### Medium-Term (Next 30 Days)
1. **Achieve Profitability** - Return to $1,000+ balance
2. **Hit 60%+ Win Rate** - Match whale success rate
3. **Identify Edge** - What patterns lead to best returns?
4. **Scale Strategy** - From $1k paper to real capital consideration

**System Verdict**: Operational with MAJOR UPGRADE. Core infrastructure works. Watchlist upgraded from $29k max to $17.4M whales (600x improvement). Now tracking proven Nansen-verified performers.

**Biggest Opportunity**: Our Tier 1 whales ($10M+ each) have proven 75%-579% ROI. When they buy, we BUY. The edge is following winners, not discovering them.

**Latest Upgrade (Oct 6, 12:08 PM)**: Added 5 Nansen-verified whales with $51.9M combined proven performance. System now tracking institutional-grade signals from Solana's top memecoin traders.
