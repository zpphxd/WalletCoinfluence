## Executive Summary

**Alpha Wallet Scout** is an AI-powered crypto intelligence platform that identifies profitable wallet addresses, detects trading confluence, and delivers high-probability trade signals via Telegram alerts.

### The Opportunity
- **Market**: $2.4T crypto market with 580M+ global users (2025)
- **TAM**: $12B+ crypto intelligence & trading tools market
- **Target**: 50,000 crypto traders seeking edge in memecoin/altcoin markets
- **Revenue Model**: Freemium SaaS ($0-$297/mo tiers)
- **Projections**: $3M ARR by Year 3 (10,000 paid users @ 20% conversion)

### Traction
- **MVP Status**: Fully operational production system
- **Live Data**: 38 trending tokens tracked, 3 wallets discovered (first 24 hours)
- **Tech Stack**: Production-grade Python backend with PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
- **APIs Integrated**: 9+ free data sources (GeckoTerminal, DEX Screener, Alchemy, Helius)
- **AI Ready**: On-demand LLM integration (Ollama/Phi-3) for signal validation

---

## The Problem

### Retail Crypto Traders Lose Money
- **95% of crypto traders lose money** in volatile altcoin/memecoin markets
- **Information asymmetry**: Institutional players and insiders have access to on-chain data, retail traders don't
- **Signal overload**: Existing tools provide too many low-quality signals
- **No attribution**: Traders don't know which wallets are actually profitable

### Current Solutions Are Inadequate

| Platform | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Nansen** | $150/mo, institutional focus, not memecoin-optimized |
| **Arkham** | Blockchain forensics, not actionable trading signals |
| **DexScreener** | Token data only, no wallet intelligence |
| **Twitter/CT** | Manual tracking, no automation, high noise |
| **Telegram Alpha Groups** | $50-500/mo, unverified claims, no transparency |

**The Gap**: No affordable, automated system that identifies *proven profitable wallets*, tracks them in real-time, and delivers *only high-conviction signals* with AI validation.

## The Solution

### Alpha Wallet Scout: AI-Powered Wallet Intelligence

**Core Value Proposition**: Follow the money, not the hype.

#### How It Works (5-Step Workflow)

```
1. DATA AGGREGATION (9 Free Sources)
   ↓
   • GeckoTerminal trending pools
   • DEX Screener hot pairs
   • Pump.fun new launches (Solana)
   • GMGN trending (Solana)
   • Token Sniffer + DexTools + CoinGecko + Birdeye
   ↓
2. WALLET DISCOVERY (Blockchain APIs)
   ↓
   • Alchemy API (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum)
   • Helius API (Solana)
   • Fetch recent buyers of trending tokens
   • Build database of 10,000+ wallet addresses
   ↓
3. PERFORMANCE FILTERING (30-Day Stats)
   ↓
   • Calculate FIFO PnL for each wallet
   • Being-Early Score (0-100): buy timing + market cap + position size
   • Filter for wallets with >$10k profit, >3x best trade, >70 early score
   • Create watchlist of ~500 profitable wallets
   ↓
4. REAL-TIME MONITORING (5-Min Intervals)
   ↓
   • Poll watchlist wallets for new trades
   • Detect confluence (≥2 wallets buying same token within 30 min)
   • Preliminary scoring (0-100) based on wallet stats + token metrics
   ↓
5. AI VALIDATION + ALERTS (On-Demand LLM)
   ↓
   • LLM activates ONLY if:
     - Preliminary score >75/100 OR
     - Confluence detected (≥2 wallets) OR
     - Labeled whale detected
   • LLM provides: BUY/HOLD/AVOID + confidence score + reasoning
   • Telegram alert sent with wallet labels, explorer links, DexScreener chart
```

#### Key Features

**1. Wallet Attribution**
- Every signal shows wallet address, 30-day PnL, best trade, early score
- Transparent performance metrics (not marketing hype)

**2. Confluence Detection**
- Redis-powered time-window detection
- Alerts trigger when ≥2 watchlist wallets buy same token within 30 min
- Example: "🚨 CONFLUENCE (3 wallets) - $PEPE - Avg 30D PnL: $127k"

**3. AI-Enhanced Scoring**
- On-demand LLM (cost: $0.002/alert vs. continuous $50/day)
- Only activates for high-probability signals
- Provides reasoning: "Strong confluence + high early scores + low market cap"

**4. Multi-Chain Coverage**
- Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum (via Alchemy)
- Solana (via Helius)
- Expandable to BSC, Polygon, Avalanche

**5. Automated Watchlist Maintenance**
- Daily rollup: add wallets with recent wins, remove under-performers
- Self-improving system that adapts to market conditions

## Appendix: Technical Details

### Being-Early Score Formula
```
Score (0-100) = 40 × (1 - rank_percentile) +
                40 × ((1M - market_cap) / 1M) +
                20 × (volume_percentile)

Where:
- rank_percentile = wallet's buy order rank among all buyers (0 = first, 1 = last)
- market_cap = token market cap at time of buy (capped at $1M)
- volume_percentile = wallet's buy volume vs. total volume (0-1)
```

**Example:**
- Wallet bought 3rd out of 100 buyers → rank_percentile = 0.03 → 40×0.97 = 38.8
- Market cap at buy: $200k → 40×(800k/1M) = 32
- Volume: Top 10% → 20×0.9 = 18
- **Total Score: 88.8/100** (Excellent early entry)

### Confluence Detection (Redis)
```python
# Redis sorted set: key = token_address, score = timestamp, member = wallet_address
redis.zadd(f"confluence:{token_address}", {wallet_address: timestamp})

# Get wallets that bought within 30-min window
window_start = now - 1800  # 30 min
wallets = redis.zrangebyscore(f"confluence:{token_address}", window_start, now)

if len(wallets) >= 2:
    trigger_confluence_alert(token_address, wallets)
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Wallets (discovered from blockchain)
CREATE TABLE wallets (
    address VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    chain_id VARCHAR(20),
    first_seen_at TIMESTAMP,
    labels JSONB  -- ["whale", "sniper", "degen"]
);

-- Trades (all buys/sells)
CREATE TABLE trades (
    tx_hash VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    wallet_address VARCHAR(100) REFERENCES wallets(address),
    token_address VARCHAR(100) REFERENCES tokens(token_address),
    side VARCHAR(4),  -- "buy" or "sell"
    amount_usd DECIMAL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Wallet Stats (30-day rolling)
CREATE TABLE wallet_stats_30d (
    wallet_address VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES wallets(address),
    pnl_usd DECIMAL,
    best_trade_multiple DECIMAL,
    being_early_score INTEGER,
    num_trades INTEGER,
    win_rate DECIMAL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
